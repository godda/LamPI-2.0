<h1>Change History</h1>
<p>This document describes the main changes made for a certain release</p>
<p>Release 2.6 </p>
<ul>
  <li>Solved a bug in ALL OFF command for a room. Since the id (used in the GUI) and the unit number used in the daemon might differ we need to make sure that ALL OFF command works as expected (on unit number).</li>
  <li>Changed the CSS system significantly. Templates are now available in scss-styles directory that can be used together with tools like &quot;koala&quot; to build new Look and Feel in a matter of minutes.</li>
</ul>
