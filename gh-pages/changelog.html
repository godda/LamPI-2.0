<h1>Change History</h1>
<p>This document describes the main changes made for a certain release</p>
<p>Release 2.6 </p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a health indicator in the header area. The color of this little bar indicates the health of the client-daemon communication</li>
  <li>Solved a bug in ALL OFF command for a room. Since the id (used in the GUI) and the unit number used in the daemon might differ we need to make sure that ALL OFF command works as expected (on unit number).</li>
  <li>Changed the CSS system significantly. Templates are now available in scss-styles directory that can be used together with tools like &quot;koala&quot; to build new Look and Feel in a matter of minutes.</li>
  <li>Display the current skin in the &quot;skin settings&quot; dialog, and make the current skin the default option in the drop-down menu</li>
  <li>Define a scaling css template</li>
</ul>
