<h1>Zwave Devices</h1>
<p>Zwave is a prototcol working on 868MHz for controlling home automation devices. In comparicon with the 433MHz series of devices, the ZWave protocol allows bi-directional communication and will allow devices to transmit values (back) to the controller as well. his means that it is possible to ask the device for its settings and this makes the protocol a lot more reliable than the 433 MHz protocol.</p>
<p>In the 1.9 release of LamPI, it is not yet possible to &quot;pair&quot; or intervicew the 868MHz devices from the LamPI user interface. As a result, this one-time pairing needs to be initiated from the classic interface that ships ith the Razberry device.</p>
