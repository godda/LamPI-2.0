<h1> Making Sensors Graphs</h1>
<p>All the sensor data that we collect can be used to show real-time sensor information on the screen. However, apart from showing this real-time info in gauges, sliders or other graphics, often sensor data makes most sense if users see trend lines over time.</p>
<p>For this purpose, I included the rrdtool library into LamPI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Installing rrdtool</h1>
<p>Before being able to define or even show sensor data in graphs, rrdtool and driver software needs to be loaded to the system.</p>
<p> sudo apt-get -y install python-smbus<br>
sudo apt-get -y install python-dev</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The graphing process</h1>
<p>If all rrd software is installed, all sensors are working and we have a process in place to get sensor data in some form available by calling a script, then we are ready for the next steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extract </strong>the sensor values from one or more executables
    <ul>
      <li>/home/pi/rrd/scripts/bmp085_extract.py</li>
      <li>/home/pi/rrd/scripts/ds18b20_extract.sh<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Update</strong> the rrdtool databases with these values<br>
    The update script is called to updatethe rrdtool databases with values measured by our sensors.
    <ul>
      <li>/home/pi/rrd/scripts/update.sh<br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Generate</strong> graph files (.png) to show on our website<br>
    One or several files can be defined that convert the data in .rrd files into graphics file.
    <br>
<ul>
      <li>/home/pi/rrd/scripts/generate.sh</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
