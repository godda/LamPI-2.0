<h1>Hardware</h1>
<p>This page deals with the hardware that we need to connect to the Raspberry PI in order to communicatie with 433MHz receivers or Handsets and turn your RPI into a full functioning control center.</p>
<p>How to make the RaspberryPI a transmitter/receiver device for 433MHz? It is probably simpler than you thinkt. Apart from the PI itself you need two really cheap small pieces of hardware, some solder and wires and a little time to put it together. So what you need are a small transmitter board and a receiver board. These boards are sold on eBay, Aliexpress and some internet shops for prices ranging from 2 $ a pair to 20$ for a receiver. In my experience, both cheap and more expensive boards work OK, if have both.</p>
<p>And how to connect your Weather and Energy Sensors? </p>

<h3>Cheap eBay</h3>
<p>In the picture you see a receiver (L) and transmitter (R) pair that can be bought for around 3$ a pair wih free shipping. It is Chinese made, and although specifications might differ from unit to unit, they work quite OK</p>

<p>Frankly, I love these sets as for just 10$ I can make at least 5 prototype boards and see which one fits my PI better. </p>

<h3>Superheterodyne kit (eBay)</h3>
<p>Ok, these look better than the cheap kit, and the good news is that they are better. </p>

<p>And the load of these superheterodyne kits so low enough that futher work with low pass filters etc may not be necessary anymore.</p>
<p><img src="hardware/vmstat_superheterodyne_noload.JPG" width="893" height="549"></p>
<p>As you can see from the screendump of a terminal to one of my PIs, the load of the transmitter/receiver combo on the system (no GUI actions, only LamPI-daemon running, syste receiving weather station messages only) is very low. If you compare the load of this set with the cheap one above you see that it uses less than half of the cpu power that the cheap kit uses.</p>
<p>For your final version, where you need to rely on in your house, this may be a safe choice of transmitter/receiver.</p>
<h3>iPrototype</h3>
<p>The Dutch internetshop iPrototype also sells transmitters and receivers  and their quality is very good, and comparable to the Superheterodyne set described above..</p>

<h2>FSK</h2>
<p>I bought a set of FSK transmitter/receivers as well. These work OK in a FSK environment only and are not usable for Klikaankliuit communication.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Filter</h2>
<p>Especially the receivers can pick up quite some noise, expecially in an urban area. I have been experimenting with external filters that would keep the higher-frequency crap from my receiver, and some people like those in pilight for example make an art of building a filter around those components. During my experiments I found out that with good software design the system time that these receivers use for interrupt handling can be kept close to 10-30% max, which leaves about 75% idle time that can be used for LamPI-daemon processing and GUI handling.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the more expensive units work slightly better and consume less computer resources too.</p>
